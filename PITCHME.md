## Value of DDD

> Domain-Driven Design focuses on the *collaboration between a development team and business experts* to create an understanding of a *problem domain* using a shared *Ubiquitous Language* to describe it. It is this collaboration and construction of a Ubiquitous Language that makes DDD so powerful. It enables a greater understanding of the problem domain (for the business and the development team) and more effective communication. These key values have a massive impact on projects as they place far greater importance on analysis and understanding over technical frameworks and methodologies, which ultimately make software products successful.

> Scott Millett. “Principles, Patterns and Practices of Domain-Driven Design.”

* Businesses whose processes are even moderately complex require multiple models.

* There is no *one* canonical/enterprise/unified model.
